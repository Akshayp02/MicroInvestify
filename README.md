<p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    The diagram below outlines the overall architecture of the <strong>Microinvestify</strong>. 
    The platform is designed to enable users to invest in stocks and cryptocurrencies with real-time data integration. 
    The frontend, developed using <strong>React</strong>, interacts with the backend powered by <strong>Spring Boot</strong>, 
    allowing seamless data flow and user authentication. 
    <br><br>
    The backend communicates with external services such as the <strong>Alpha Vantage API</strong> for fetching live stock and 
    cryptocurrency data, and <strong>PayPal API</strong> for secure payment processing. The <strong>MySQL</strong> database is 
    used to store user information, investment data, and transaction history.
    <br><br>
    This architecture ensures a scalable and efficient system for handling micro-investments, real-time market trends, 
    and secure transactions.
